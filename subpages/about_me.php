    <div class="about_me_div">Welcome to my project! This website is part of my school assignment. It is designed to make language learning easier and more enjoyable by providing a platform where users can create custom dictionaries and study vocabulary through flashcards.</div>
    <div class="about_me_div">Throughout the development of this project, I’ve gained valuable experience in web development, database management, and creating user-friendly interfaces. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding experience to bring this idea to life.</div>
    <div class="about_me_div">The main purpose of this project is to help people enhance their vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. By using personalized dictionaries and interactive flashcards, users can quickly learn and retain new words.</div>
    <div class="about_me_div">In the future, I hope to expand the features of this site and make it even more useful for those who want to improve their language skills. My goal is to create a tool that supports learners of all levels.</div>
